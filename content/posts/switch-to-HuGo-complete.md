title: Hugo Switch complete!

Hello from HuGo!  
  
Scope has slightly changed, I am going to keep hosting this on GitHub Pages, as codeberg pages and actions is not reliable enough. Also, I do not want to impose my arguably irrelevant blog on Codeberg (at least not at this time). BUT, I will switch to Codeberg for my coding projects. In the long term, I would like to self host and federate through [ForgeFed](https://github.com/forgefed/forgefed), but that is in its infancy.
