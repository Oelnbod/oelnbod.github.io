# About me. 
<img src="/assets/images/Other/me.jpg" alt="Me!" width="400"> 
<p></p>
Hi, I am a person (yes, really).

I am a student programmer, an advocate for digital privacy and cybersecurity and a photographer. 
My photos are available here: https://www.pexels.com/@oelnbod/

I am passionate about FOSS, Human Rights, stopping Climate Change and ending the kleptocracy.

My (current) preffered distro is rocky Linux. 

My username comes from removing the first and last characters from my name (Joel Nelson Body) and the addition of my middle initial. Looking up "Body" or a computer is a bad idea. *Never* Call me Oelnbod or my full name in person. ðŸ˜ƒ 

# About this website. 
  
This website is currently hosted on github pages and built with Jekyll and Minima. I am looking at migrating to HuGo. The repo is [here](https://github.com/Oelnbod/oelnbod.github.io). 
  
Everything written here (excluding other's works) is CC0, but I would appreciate credit. My photos on Pexels are licensed under the pexels license: [https://www.pexels.com/license/](https://www.pexels.com/license/)

Schedule: whenever I feel like it.
