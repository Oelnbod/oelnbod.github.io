Hi, I am a person (yes, really).

I am a student programmer(rust and python), an advocate for digital privacy and cybersecurity and a photographer. 
My photos areavailable here: https://www.pexels.com/@oelnbod/

My preffered distro is rocky Linux. 

My username comes from removing the first and last characters from my name (Joel Body) and the addition of my middle initial.

Everything written here (excluding other's works) is CC0, but I would appreciate credit. 

Schedule: whenever I feel like it.
