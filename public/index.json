I have not.\nSorry. üò•\nBut it started in Auckland, seeing friends of my parents and my extended family. Even though I did not know them, they were lovely to meet. And even though we went to see them, seeing the views from their houses was also spectacular. The view from sky tower was beautiful, as well. Almost all of the bad weather happened whilst we were in Auckland\nThen we flew to Whanganui, but our Air Chathams ATR 72 was diverted over WhakatƒÅne, which may seem like an inconvenience (it was more of an inconvenience for the people flying from WhakatƒÅne to Auckland via Whanganui), but it was not. We flew over lake Taupo, Mt Ruapehu and got a beautiful view of Mt Taranaki. I could not have wanted a better scenic flight.\nWhanganuj was beautiful, the sunset from the mole was lovely. And Bushy Park was awesome! Seeing my family was also great!\nThen we drove down to Wellington, which gave us an amazing view from island bay. Zealandia was also amazing!\nWe then flew down to Queenstown on an A320 where we went down the Luge (great fun) and saw the Kiwis in the Kiwi house.\nWe then drove to Wanaka, where we saw Mt Aspiring on the drive in and saw the Wanaka tree on the way out.\nThen we went up to Glentanner, which sits at the foot top of Lake Pukaki. Even though it was overcast as we arrived, on the second day the Peak of Aoraki/Mt Cook appeared. But then just before we left, Aoraki showed its full self with picture perfect blue skies. And on the final night, the Milky Way was visible with naked eyes. The true absence of light pollution was amazing!\nWe then drove to near Queenstown, and visited family. Then having seen the Cathedral, the red zone and the city from the Port Hills (Sign of the Kiwi caf√© is excellent), we finished in Christchurch airport - where we are now waiting to board flight NZ570 (another A320) to Auckland where we fly on to Kuala Lumpur before visiting Penang for a few days.\nThanks Aotearoa New Zealand ‚ù§\n","permalink":"http://0.0.0.0:7878/posts/thanks-aotearoa/","title":"Thanks Aotearoa."},{"content":" DO NOT VERIFY YOUR AGE!

If you do not know Calvin, drop everything and go straight to your library. Now!\nThe other night, I was up way too late and I began to see meaning Calvin \u0026amp; Hobbes. I saw how anti-establishment \u0026amp; willing to break society Calvin was. How (with some exceptions for his laziness and sexism) he challenged the norm and expectations. The way he approached school, friendship and culture.\nCalvin was not willing to work with a system that did not work. When he wanted to play and learn together (as is now being pioneered in some schools) he was told no - with no reason and so fought the system. He could not understand why he had to play sport and so he went his own way. He could not understand why he had to waste his time.\nHe was constantly told to build character, and he built character in his own way, he became a character as he refused to conform to the pointless.\nCalvin had both such a na√Øvety, but with such an awareness of the world. He recognised that \u0026ldquo;the scariest thing you can imagine\u0026rdquo; is a \u0026ldquo;barrel of toxic waste\u0026rdquo;, but at the same time interpreted \u0026ldquo;stuff it [Hobbes when first caught]\u0026rdquo; to mean to stuff him with food. Which you never see: everyone I know (and maybe even myself) would pick a monster (etc) and would not stuff a tiger with food.\nAnd at the same time, he was unafraid to speak truth to power. He would challenge Moe with \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s true Moe. How about that?\u0026rdquo; He would not accept the privilidge and authority that adults had, because he could not see the fundamental difference. He would not accept having to learn what appears to be pointless. He would not accept that the one-size-fits-all of forced education system when he understood that children needed freedom and needed to play. And maybe some of his fights were the wrong fight, but he had the spirit to fix the world. He had the spirit to fight. And maybe in this world of turmoil and chaos, maybe we need more people who are willing to fight. Who are willing to fix it. Not just in isolated circles, but we need everyone to stand up to injustice and institutional failure. We need people who are willing to stand up, whilst the world burns around us, and bring change.\nMaybe Calvin brought this energy for change.

I can feel it, I think the changes in the world around me, I believe that the turning point in the fight for internet self-determination; the fight against censorship; the fight for freedom will come in the next 4 years. The year of the GNU/Linux desktop is coming.\nWhat makes me think this? I am hearing people talk about enshittification like never before. Never before have I seen fellow students talking about the how unjust it is to not own software, to only license it. Never before have I seen my friends ask me about trying GNU/Linux. Never have I seen normal people care about this. The companies have moved too far, too fast, they have created an incredibly savvy youth who can recognize bullshit as bullshit, they have alienated their user base, they have shot themselves in the face.\nNow we are seeing movements like EndOf10 who are will bring the largest loss of windows users, windows may be staring down into the face of the largest mass exodus from proprietary users. Microsoft have deceived themselves into believing that they have a monopoly, when really they have competitors - us. They want to replace 240 million computers that people owned, and replace it with 240 million computers owned by Microsoft * co. And that is such a monumentally expensive cost, normal people have looked it up, they have not taken it at face value, they have decided to switch. And at the same time, GNU/Linux distros are coming to meet the demand, coming to tailor to the demands of these operating system refugees. Operating systems like zorin or EU OS (based on Fedora Kionite) are optimising for these displaced people, they are looking to replace windows as the default desktop. They are looking to replace the default of corporate driven kleptocratic surveillance capitalism with FREEDOM .\nAnd this is not just an isolated event, we are seeing people move off traditional, centralised social media to decentralised federated social media, to platforms like Bluesky and the diverse. And yes, these platforms need improvement (I would like to see Bluesky become practically federated) but this progress will come with more people. We are seeing mass campaigns against Tesla and Musk, we are seeing campaigns against the kleptocrcy, against the Trump administration. The people have woken up and realised that this is not them, enshittification is real. And with privacy becoming one issue that can unite across the political spectrum, people are taking action against this. The kleptocrats have finally shown their hand, and we do not like it. And the best part, they showed it too soon, we can and will stop them. They could have enshittified earlier, where we would not have had the savvy youth (that is one thing that AI brainrot has taught, that is not widely noticed, my friends are incredibly good at recognizing AI generated images) or if they enshittifed later, we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have noticed and would not have fought it, they thought that privacy and human rights and enshittification was just an issue of the few internet freedom advocates - but NO it is a universal issue that unites all of us.\nI am hopeful, that the soft revolution is coming, that freedom is coming.\n","permalink":"http://0.0.0.0:7878/posts/the-soft-revolution-is-coming/","title":"The Soft Revolution Is Coming."},{"content":"How I submerge my camera in a pond. Recently I have built a pond, which has attracted tadpoles.\nAs a photographer, I desperately wanted to photograph the tadpoles in said pond. However, I do not have an underwater housing or the money to buy one (and it was suboptimal as it would make operation difficult as I cannot see the LCD), further I did not have a probe lens or the money for one. So this left me with a difficult situation for submerging my camera.\nInitially I tried using a glass cooking bowl and placing my camera inside. This worked for some basic top down photos in the shallows, but did not give me much depth. It was also not stable enough to support my camera - preventing me tethering my phone as a monitor. Viewing the monitor clearly is particularly important as I cannot access the viewfinder and the live-view autofocus on my EOS 7D was particularly unusable underwater - leaving me with manual focus only. In this dilemma, I asked online here for some advice (thanks). This is a summary of my experiences from this.\nThe first challenge was submerging my camera, with the simplest and most promising option from above was the fish tank method, and this is the one that I tried. I found a free fish tank of dimensions ~20x20x30cm. I placed this into my pond and placed my camera inside. The bottom of the fish tank was about 3cm deep. \u0026#x1f61e; My first solution was to add ~2kg of water (bottled) to the bottom of the tank. This kind of worked, my camera was submerged enough for me to be able to fit the entire frame underwater at 17mm APS-C (~27mm FF). However, there were some serious drawbacks: firstly, the camera was above the bottles - so my frame was only just below the waterline, secondly the water bottles were not heavy enough for proper viewing of tadpoles (unless I pushed down on the tank - hard - inhibiting precise operation). Further, the camera was not fixed in place - making manoeuvring hard as I had to hold both the container and the camera. This led me to my current solution of using ~4kg of screws in small boxes and distributed across the fish tank, so that the tank remained balanced, allowing me to place the camera lower without risking water spillage. These could also hold the camera in place (as two smaller boxes were the exact size as to hold the camera between them), and allowed the camera to be at the bottom of the container - making it much deeper.\nThis relocation to the bottom of a fish tank with all controls inaccessible led me to new problems, how to control the camera. This was particularly difficult as there is no vari-angle screen on my camera, so I was unable to view my focus and composure. Further, my camera does not have WIFI and I am unwlling to use a laptop here for tethering. I had previously eliminated external monitors due to their absurd cost. This left me with USB tethering to my phone. This was initially though to be implausible due to many apes being advertised as having a cost (which requires Google play store to pay - so I was unwilling to use), after much research I found many identical apps on Aptiode that were suitable - albeit a little unreliable, but were suitable at the cost. You can take your pick of what one. The use of a micro B USB cable and a USB c to USB A, etc dock allowed me to connect my camera - I already had these cables. The only issues with this setup was the unreliability of the connection, which either refused to connect or an error was displayed on the camera when I had magic lantern installed and having a low frame rate live view (sub 25) after recording video.\nThis different method of operation required some different settings on my camera. As I did not have tactile focus control, or the option of putting my lens on manual as I needed to control it from the focus option on my phone, when I pressed the shutter on my phone the lens would focus and then take a photo - which is problematic due to the delay and the poor performance of the live view AF. This was resolvable by setting the shutter button to not focus (through the custom controls option) and saving this to a custom function on the mode dial.\nPhotos taken using both the fish tank and the more glass bowl can be found here Thanks for reading! :)\n","permalink":"http://0.0.0.0:7878/posts/how-i-take-photos-in-a-pond/","title":"How I Take Photos In My Pond."},{"content":"https://wego.here.com an alternative to google maps sattellite view.\nhttps://grapheneos.org/ the android version that I run on my pixel 6.\nhttps://www.magiclantern.fm/ bonus features for canon cameras.\nhttps://rockylinux.org possibly my favourite distro.
