    <p>If you are not redirected automatically, follow this <a href="https://www.pexels.com/@oelnbod/">link to my photos on Pexels.</a>.</p>
	<p>If you are wondering why I my photos are on Pexels, it is for 2 reasons. 1, github pages (which this site is hosted through) has a storage limit and so I can't store many high resolution images here. Further, I started publishing my photos on Pexels before I started blogging. For context my high resolution backup of both .jepg and .j2k is ~50GB on 2025-05-13. </p>
<p> I chose pexels basically by chance, but I do like my images being licensed as CC0, being curated as that helps me for personal improvement and it being free (money)!</p>
