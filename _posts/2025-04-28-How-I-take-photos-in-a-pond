title: How I take photos in a pond
tags: photography, guide, pond

Recently I have built a pond, which has attracted tadpoles.   
As a photographer, I *desperately* wanted to photograph the tadpoles in said pond. However, I do not have an underwater housing or the money to buy one (and it was suboptimal as it would make operation difficult as I cannot see the LCD), further I did not have a probe lens or the money for one. So this left me with a difficult situation for submerging my camera.  
 
Initially I tried using a glass cooking bowl and placing my camera inside. This worked for some basic top down photos in the shallows, but did not give me much depth. It was also not stable enough to support my camera - preventing me tethering my phone as a monitor. Viewing the monitor clearly is particularly important as I cannot access the viewfinder and the live-view autofocus on my EOS 7D was particularly unusable underwater - leaving me with manual focus only. 
In this dilemma, I asked online [here](https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/136526/how-to-submerge-camera-in-pond/136529#136529) for some advice (thanks). This is a summary of my experiences from this.   

The first challenge was suerging my camera, with the simplest and most promising option from above was the fishtank method, and this is the one that I tried. I found a free fishtank of dimensions _x_x_. I placed this into my pond annd placed my camera inside. The bottom of the fishtank was about 3cm deep. :disappointed: My first solution was to add ~2kg of water (bottled) to the bottom of the tank. This kind of worked, my camera was submerged enough for me to be able to fit the entire frame underwater at 17mm aps-c (~27mm ff). However, there were some serious drawbacks: firstly, the camera was above the bottles - so my frame was only just below the waterline, secondly the water bottles were not heavy enough for proper viewing of tadpoles (unless I pushed down on the tank - *hard*)
