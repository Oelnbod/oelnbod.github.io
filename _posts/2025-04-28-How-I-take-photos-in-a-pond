title: How I take photos in a pond
tags: photography, guide, pond

Recently I have built a pond, which has attracted tadpoles.   
As a photographer, I *desperately* wanted to photograph the tadpoles in said pond. However, I do not have an underwater housing or the money to buy one (and it was suboptimal as it would make operation difficult as I cannot see the LCD), further I did not have a probe lens or the money for one. So this left me with a difficult situation for submerging my camera.   
Initially I tried using a glass cooking bowl and placing my camera inside. This worked for some basic top down photos in the shallows, but did not give me much depth. It was also not stable enough to support my camera - preventing me tethering my phone as a monitor. Viewing the monitor clearly is particularly important as I cannot access the viewfinder and the live-view autofocus on my EOS 7D was particularly unusable underwater - leaving me with manual focus only. 
In this dilemma, I asked online [here](https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/136526/how-to-submerge-camera-in-pond/136529#136529)
