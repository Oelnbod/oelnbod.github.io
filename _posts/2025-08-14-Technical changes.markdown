A lot about this website is about to change.  

Firstly, this website is moving to a different domain (oelnbod.codeberg.page). This is to try and leave Github, as encouraged by  [this post]. This link will redirect, as I am unable to fully migrate off Github for other reasons and so will keep this account. All old posts will also be carried forward.  
  
I am also moving to HuGo, which is a more modern static site generator. This will lead to a UI change for this ugly website.
