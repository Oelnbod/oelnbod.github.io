I am going back to Aotearoa (for my 6th time!). On the way back, I am stopping for a few days in Penang. 

This is to see my family and to see the beautiful nature. 
  
I will post some preliminary photos on mastodon (see footer), from my phone. I am not travelling with a computer, so I will only post photos from my camera when I get back (in ~1 month) on pexels after editing. I may also blog a bit. 
  
The journey is pretty good when going through Malaysia air (as far as possible for a 12hr flight followed by a 10hr one). It has been an A350-900 (with a slightly updated cabin) for LHR-KUL and an A330-900 for KUL-AKL. Equally, I am *craving* getting off in ~50mins.   
  
If you want to contact me, expect *extreme* delays, as UTC+12 basically leaves no overlap with European time zones. But I at points I may have *lots* of time available to respond, so you can still contact me. ðŸ˜ƒ
