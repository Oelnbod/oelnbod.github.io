When I say Calvin, I mean Bill Waterson's Calvin & Hobbes. If you do not know Calvin, drop *everything* and go straight to your library. *Now!*  
  
The other night, I was up *way* too late and I began to see meaning Calvin & Hobbes. I saw how antiwestablishment & willing to break society Calvin was. How (with some exceptions for his laziness and sexism) he challenged the norm and expectations. The way he approached school, friendship and culture.  
  
Calvin was not willing to work with a system that did not work. When he wanted to play and learn  together (as is now being pioneered in some schools) he was told no - with no reason and so fought the system. 
  
He could not understand why he had to play sport and so he went his own way. He could not understand why he had to waste his time. 
  
He was *constantly* told to build character, and he built character in his own way, he became a *character* as he refused to conform to the pointless.
