Unfortunately the Online "Safety" Act (OSA) is here. If you are in the UK, you might get told to verify your age with ID, digital ID, mobile & email checks, credit card checks, payment details or a selfie video. 
  
## ***DO NOT DO THIS!!***  
  
We do not know how secure this data is. Companies collecting *millions* of people's ID, bank details and videos of themselves tied to name *could not be more attractive to hackers*.  It is reasonable to *assume* that this data will be hacked. Because you cannot change your face, this data has to be safe *for the rest of your life*. And with the *ludicrous* growth in computing power (even if Moore's law is defunct, which isn't necessarily true) and with the advent of quantumn computing - a store now, crack later model is *insanely* practical for hackers when faced with such stupendously valuable data. 
  
I cannot state this enough, this data is the *holy grail* of personal data. Hackers *will* be trying *desperately* to breach this. Because with that data, it is possible to impersonate you to a level beyond what we have seen today. 
  
## So what are your options?
1. Use a trusted public VPN.
2. Host your own VPN (technical and expensive)
3. The Onion Router (dangerous)

### Use a trusted public VPN
A VPN will circumvent the age checks, by redirecting your traffic to another country. But crucially, don't use some free VPN you have found. You must use a VPN that you can have a strong reason to believe is not spying on you. These companies and their internet providers have unrestricted access to your internet traffic, which can be used to target you with advertising. Pick a VPN from a nonprofit (like riseup.net) or a VPN that has a strong profit model. Pick VPNs that are iso27001 certified where possible and based in the EU, where GDPR is *actually* enforced. I personally use proton VPN, which is both iso27001 certified and swiss based (where GDPR & DPA is strictly enforced).
