Unfortunately the Online "Safety" Act (OSA) is here. If you are in the UK, you might get told to verify your age with ID, bank cards or a selfie video. 
  
## ***DO NOT DO THIS!!***  
  
We do not know how secure this data is. Companies collecting *millions* of people's ID, bank details and videos of themselves tied to name *could not be more attractive to hackers*.  It is reasonable to *assume* that this data will be hacked. Because you cannot change your face, this data has to be safe *for the rest of your life*. And with the *ludicrous* growth in computing power (even if Moore's law is defunct, which isn't necessarily true) and with the advent of quantumn computing - a store now, crack later model is *insanely* practical for hackers when faced with such stupendously valuable data. 
  
I cannot state this enough, this data is the *holy grail* of personal data. Hackers *will* be trying *desperately* to breach this. Because with that data, it is possible to impersonate you to a level beyond what we have seen today.
