# Abingdon-EndOf10
Windows 10 is ending support on October 14th 2025. This will lead to over 250 *million* computers vulnerable to hacking and will become incompatable with modern software. As most people replace their computers at this point, many computers will end up in e-waste. E-waste is incredibly toxic and harmful if not safely recycled. Just have a look at the inforgraphic below! However, instead of replacing your computer, you can install a version of GNU/Linux (called a distro), this is often percieved as a more complex process than installing Windows (which often comes pre-installed), but we can help! We are offering to help you install a GNU/Linux distro and help you get up and running with using it.  
Please come along, we don't bite!  ðŸ˜„
