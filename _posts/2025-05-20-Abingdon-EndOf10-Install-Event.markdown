## Summary
Windows 10 ends support on October 14th 2025. This is predicted to send ***250 million*** computers to landfill.   
This is *extremely* bad for the environment.   
***But you can stop this.***  
***Installing Linux*** (a replacement operating system) can ***keep your computer running.***    
Despite what you may have heard, Linux is a very mature Operating System.  
To help you make the switch, we are running an ***install event*** from ***10am-3pm on Saturday the 28th of June*** at the Abingdon Library. 
Here ***we will help you migrate to Linux*** (including installation and guidance, etc).
If you are planning to attend, please backup your data and files beforehand - but if you do not know/have the resources to do this we can backup your data (but it would help us if you did itüòÉ).   
If you are planning on coming, don't forget your charger for laptops or keyboaard+mouse for a desktops
  
## Why
Windows 10 is ending support on October 14th 2025. This will lead to over  ***250 million***  computers vulnerable to hacking and will become incompatable with modern software. As most people replace their computers at this point, many computers will end up in e-waste. E-waste is incredibly toxic and harmful if not safely recycled. Just have a look at the inforgraphic below! However, instead of replacing your computer, you can install a version of GNU/Linux (called a distro), this is often percieved as a more complex process than installing Windows (which often comes pre-installed), but we can help! We are offering to help you install a GNU/Linux distro and help you get up and running with using it.  <br>
For more details of the environmental impact have a look at the infographic on the left! <br>
Please come along, we don't bite!  üòÑ
