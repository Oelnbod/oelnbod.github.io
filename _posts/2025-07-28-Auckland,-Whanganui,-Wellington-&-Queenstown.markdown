For the past 10 days, I have been staying with members of my extended family.  
  
I am happy I no longer have to see them in person for at *least* a year (and possibly some of them for over 5 years). 
  
They are varying degrees of arseholes. And by arsehole I mean:  

> A person, who is almost always male, who considers himself of much greater moral or social importance than everyone else; who allows himself to enjoy special advantages and does so systematically; who does this out of an entrenched sense of entitlement; and who is immunized by his sense of entitlement against the complaints of other people. He feels he is not to be questioned, and he is the one who is chiefly wronged. [Wikipedia]
  
My grandmother spent most of the time being *flabbergasted* (Trevor Noah's definition) at things that *hadn't even happened* and didn't happen. Nor would any reasonable person expect them to happen. Always thinking that *everyone* would do the thing that was most inconvenient thing to her - and when that *occasionally* happened, she absolutely failed to recognise that her inconvenience was *far* less important than the convenience and safety of *many* others. But, the saving grace is that it is *not* directed at me or my immediate family, just people who aren't present. This is quite unpleasant (sorry). But at least it is not directed at anyone present, which makes it ignorable to some extent. Further, my guard was raised for this - limiting the harm.

However, on one day my aunt visited. I am sorry for her children. She and my grandmother spoke *at* each other for hours. Not listening, but complaining and ego stroaking for *hours*. Constant "This person wronged me in this insignificant way whilst doing *their actual job* and trying to look after everyone's safety *and* ensuring that they follow the rules*. And to top it off, interspersed with *reckons*. And I define reckons in a very specific way:

> An uneducated and uniformed statement that is said as if the person is an expert. It is often based off of snippets of knowledge that they have overheard and their own opinions and expectations of society and people. These expectations are often (but not exclusively) cynical. The amount of accuracy can vary, but is never from an accurate understanding of the subject. The most important aspect of a reckon is that it is said with absolute certainty and conviction. It is only possible to detect a reckon if you happen to have a thorough understanding of the subject matter. 

Two people reckoning together is *awful!* My aunt and grandmother take reckoning to the next level. And when they turn to social media, AI, technofeudalism (not in that word) and agacent fields. And when their reckons are wrong, the ultimate rage-bait is created. But if I want to interject, it is impossible. The rate, volume & ignorance of others is incredible. Not only was it impossible to have another conversation, but it was impossible to find a break to speak! And that is before I consider the repercussions of interrupting! I knew that they would not have it (I didn't risk trying).  
  
Now onto my Uncle. My Uncle is a decent-ish person online and on calls. But despite this, he *IS* an arsehole. He spent 3 days showing off his wealth and entitlement. He casually drops that his *office* Lego collection is "probably worth NZ$25-30,000". He casually drops that he charges NZ$250/hr as a lawyer *and* that one of his colleagues charges NZ$60,000/hr once! My family does not have that sort of money. He is *constantly* talking about his [Nazi car] when we are in it. *CONSTANTLY!* He is constantly shutting down conversation to talk about himself. *CONSTANTLY!* He seems to enjoy pitting each of us against each other and then weighting the scales in one of our favour.  
  
Now that I have finished griping, Aotearoa New Zealand has been *absolutely* stunning! Even the (amazing) family we visited in Auckland had engaging views and spectacular conversation.  
  
In Whanganui (where my grandmother lives), the sunset from the mole was stunning and coupled with a beautiful view and a trip to *Bushy Park*, the nature was thoroughly enjoyable. And then My Uncle's house in Wellington was in Island Bay with a view right across the Cook Straight, that coupled with *excellent* weather created a  spectacular [water/land]scape. Zealandia Park was *awesome*.  
  
And now as I write this, I am driving (or more accurately being driven) along the Crown Range from a spectacular few hours in Queenstown riding the luge and visiting the Kiwis, to Wanaka for 2 nights.  
  
I'll post photos when I get home and can edit them off my camera.  
  
As the air steward said when we landed in Queenstown from Wellington: Have an above average Monday!
